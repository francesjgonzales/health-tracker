## About this project

I took reference from _LearningZity's_ youtube tutorial while learning CRUD in Vanilla Javascript. The idea came about whenever my son fall sick and I have to track his temperature, fever and medicine intake. The title and naming convention used are from a nurse's perspective when admitting a patient in a hospital. The Health Tracker stores session data, which will be retained until the session timeout occurs.

The form asks for core information about the patient where input fields are color-coded for validity-check, font-size are slightly bigger for easy readability only in desktop view and a clock to keep track of the current time.
